## Text fonts 
To make text cursive, put stars (*) or underslining on both sides of the word/sentance
Example:*this is what it would look like* or _like this_

To make text bold, put double starts on both sides of whatever you are writing or double underline
Example:**this is what it would look like** or __like this__

Alternative ways of making text cursive of bold exists so we can combine both of the ways.For example _text can be cursive and **half bold** at the same time_
